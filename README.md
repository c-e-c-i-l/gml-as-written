# gml as written _!_
#### tutorials for gamemaker that are written instead of moving pictures

Inspired by spending many hours helping folks in the unofficial GameMaker discord and by the total wasteland of modern, written gml tutorials I do hereby and humbly present **gml as written**. Immediately following this paragraph you will find a smattering of tutorials and concepts for gml: GameMaker's native scripting language. These tutorials are not particularly pointed towards total beginners nor are they exclusively for wizards. Some paint very quick, broad strokes over a topic and others take an approach of specificity. Additionally, this is not some kind of flashy, high class finished novel eitherâ€”there will be updates and additions over time as I learn new or pleasant things.
